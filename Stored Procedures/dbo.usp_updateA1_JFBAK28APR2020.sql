-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author      Jeremy Fifer
Created     10/05/15
Purpose     Updates A1 (all in one ticket) orders for use by [usp_ShippingLabels]
					and also by the A1 tab on the Intranet.
					This is called by job "i_A1_usp_ShippingLabels" which runs that sproc, which in turn runs this sproc, every 75s.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modification History
09/08/16		updated to remove commercial from a1, jf.
09/08/16		updated to work only for HOM/NCC. Added WEB portion below, thus breaking this sproc into 2 pieces.
09/30/16		modified web portion, made life, jf.
11/01/16		modified near LN 54 regarding RDI, jf.
11/16/16		Changed tblAMZ_orderShip.a1_mailRate to tblAMZ_orderShip.a1_mailPieceShape, jf.
12/20/16		added R2P section at bottom of code, jf.
12/29/16		Added @GSC8; Added new Marketplace code. Old code resides in usp_updateA1_BAKJF_122916_priortoMarketplaceShift, jf.
01/04/17		updated initial query for Marketplace with correct ship-service-level code, jf.
03/02/17		Added UPS Marketplace conditions 172 thru 177, jf.
04/05/17		Added second subquery to R2P update to include UPSLabel check for R2P settings, jf.
04/13/17		THL - Sproc will check/set flag in tblUpdateA1flag to 1 when it's running (0 when it's not) so it won't interfere with itself; set back to 0 at the end of sproc
11/20/17		BJS - Update Temp table to true temp
10/26/18		Minor updates to qual'd joins, added expedite checks in initial query, jf.
10/26/18		Updated initial query to better performance; see backup of this sproc for reversion [usp_updateA1_BAK102618_01], jf.
10/30/18		Reverted the change to the intitial query but left it commented-out inline, for future A/B testing; see inline notes, jf.
03/22/19		JF, qual'd joins.
10/30/19		JF, happy halloween mofos. I had to rewrite the Amazon section because it was not qualifying A1's properly after we renamed thousands of products on Amazon. Fun!
04/15/20		JF, updated initial AMZ data retrieval to avoid pulling in Signs.

	Goal: To reduce shipping processing time we would like orders that meet a set of requirements to receive an All-In-One Ticket with a pre-paid shipping label. 

	Job Ticket Creation: 
		 All job tickets printed from the batch print option for Marketplace NEW orders should be formatted as an A1 ticket. 
		  Specs should follow the shipping label placement for current A1 tickets through HOM/NCC orders. 
		  Jobs that do not meet the requirements for a label should still be formatted to work on the A1 label stock, 
		  they would just have no label in the location on the ticket. The goal is to print ALL tickets on the same 
		  label stock paper as most of the orders will qualify and we would only have to have a single tab to print from.
